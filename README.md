Introduction
 
This repo has all the files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 
It also has a run_analysis.R which when executed, will:

1.Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labes the data set with descriptive variable names.
4.From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This means that the script will do exactly what is asked in the instructions for the project. 

This readme will be updated if next changes come up
