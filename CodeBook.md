
The dataset obtained as described above contains 11880 observations: 
6 activity types for 30 subjects being investigated gives 80 "subject-activity" pairs, 
for each of which 66 pairs of measured variable and statistics applied (mean or standard deviation) occurs.

Hence, each observation in the created dataset contains 5 variables: "subject" identifying the person tested, 
"activity" identifying the person's activity type, "signal" showing the signal measured in the experiment  ,
"statistics" showing the processing (mean or standard deviation) applied to the measured signal to obtain the original dataset, 
and "value" containing the average of the respective signal parameter in the original dataset for each combination of subject and activity
